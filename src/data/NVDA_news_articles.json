    "content": "The Trump administration is considering new restrictions on the Chinese AI lab DeepSeek that would limit it from buying Nvidia's AI chips and potentially bar Americans from accessing its AI services, The New York Times reported on Wednesday.\n\nThe restrictions are part of the Trump administration's effort to compete with China on AI. Months after DeepSeek jolted both Silicon Valley and Wall Street, U.S. officials seem to be weighing several options to limit China's access to American technologies and consumers.\n\nOn Tuesday, the White House moved to restrict more of Nvidia's AI chip sales to China, strengthening rules created by the Biden administration.\n\nDeepSeek's popularity among U.S. AI developers has soared in recent months, and the startup's competitive pricing has forced Silicon Valley to offer frontier AI models at lower costs.\n\nThere are lingering questions, however, around whether DeepSeek engaged in IP theft to create some of its more competitive models. OpenAI has alleged that the Chinese lab distilled its models, violating OpenAI's terms of use.\n\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/trump-administration-reportedly-considers-a-us-deepseek-ban/",

    "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) plunge after comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell deepened losses sparked by costs associated with new US restrictions on exports to China.\n\nFuturum CEO Daniel Newman sits down with Josh Lipton, joined by Defiance ETFs CEO and chief investment officer Sylvia Jablonski, to discuss the latest chip news and what it means for investors.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here.\n\nNvidia sinking. So after the chip maker disclosed that it would take a $5.5 billion dollar hit from the US government's surprise new controls on its semiconductor exports to China. For more on the latest, let's welcome now Daniel Newman, Futurum CEO. Daniel, it is great to see you here on set. Appreciate it from Texas. Um, you know, before J. Powell, frankly, this was the story of the day. It was chips, it was Nvidia. Nvidia is down here, Dan. It's not about 10%. It's getting clobbered in today's trade. I guess two, two questions to start. One, Dan, were you surprised by that news when you saw those headlines? And two, do you think down 10%, is that move justified in your opinion?\n\nYeah, first of all, nobody should have been surprised by this move. Really the administration's been giving the signal that it was going to clamp down. Now, what was interesting is this week, there was a bit of gyration because they cut this deal, they announced 500 billion dollars of AI supercomputers being built here in the United States. And then a day later, he pulls back on this new export licensing requirement.\n\nThat that, you bring that, Dan. That is an interesting point because there were some folks who thought Jensen Wong was going to be kind of shielded from this. Right?\n\nThey made a deal. I had a few reporters actually hit me up, do you think there was some tip for tat going on. And first of all, I think Trump needs to show, President Trump needs to show that there is no tip for tat. So whether it's, you know, Tim Cook bringing more manufacturing here, whether it's TSMC coming here. But I actually think on the other side of this, and maybe we come back to this, is that I actually think creating some certainty with the, with the community, the business community, about what type of benefit they can expect by onshoring and bringing manufacturing back here. I think that would be a great start. Having said that, national security, economic security, and AI are tightly correlated. Us giving the chips to China, whether it's the tuned down chips or the best chips coming through intermediaries, which they shouldn't be getting. This is something that's giving an advantaging China. There's a lot of people out there that are like, oh, well, this is going to only push their resolve. Do you think China is waiting because we're sending Nvidia chips, they're not investing in Huawei and building their own chips? You can be absolutely certain that they are. This war, this trade war, is largely being fought on the grounds of long-term economic domination. Long-term economic domination will only be had if we control the technology trade. Nvidia is at the forefront of that trade.\n\nAnd what do you think of from an investor standpoint? Here you have Nvidia falling yet again, 8 to 10%. You know, look what happened over the last couple days. It had recovered from its lows, right? And a lot of investors who got in short term experienced that bounce. Where, where do you think that looks like this week?\n\nYeah. I, I look at that line of people around the corner at $150 that just couldn't wait to buy. And you go, what is really changed? Well, first of all, you've got GPUs melting over at, at X and at OpenAI. There's so much demand there. Could Nvidia pivot some of its capacity, not focus so much on building specialized products for China, and make sure we meet all the capacity and demand that's out there for companies that are in the US that are trying to build? You've got $325 billion of CAPEX. And it's been reiterated. So whether it's been Sunder Pichai, whether it's been Satya Nadella, they're all planning to spend. And I genuinely believe, Sylvia, that the companies with, you know, the big operating leverage are going to look at this pullback as the moment to build AI infrastructure out. Because when we come out of this, and we will come out of this, there will be deals made. Calling that on the record right now. It may be a tough couple of months. When deals are made, we will see the economy accelerate. And those companies want to build the future and have that AI infrastructure in place. So the Googles and the Microsofts and the Amazons, they're going to buy Nvidia. Um, and one other thing, if I, if I may, I find it very interesting that everybody thinks that China and their push to build Huawei is going to be so successful. When AMD came out with a competitive product, no one believed they could build the software. Broadcom's making chips for the hyperscalers and everyone said, well, that's great, but they don't have CUDA. So it's not going to work as well. But suddenly, everybody believes that China and Huawei is going to build the CUDA competitive product that's going to undo Nvidia? I believe in China, I believe in their resolve. I don't believe that they have as much competition or much competitive capability today as people are suggesting.",

    "content": "US President Donald Trump touts chipmaker investments in US manufacturing, with Nvidia (NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) investing hundreds of billions of dollars in the US. Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley sits down with Wealth Host Brad Smith to outline why these massive investments don't necessarily translate to a meaningful uptick in US-based tech manufacturing.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Wealth here.\n\nIt's time for tech support. Our weekly segment, all about technology and shares of one of the biggest tech companies out there in video, taking a hit today after news the company is expecting. President Trump's curbs on Chinese exports will cost the company five and a half billion dollars. Meanwhile, President Trump touted in videos investment in the US on truth, social calling it big and exciting news. I want to bring in Yahoo Finance Tech editor Dan Hally. Dan, good to see you. Will Trump's tariffs really bring tech manufacturing to the US?\n\nUh, long story short, no. Uh, this is something that uh is kind of akin to uh, what Apple did with their $500 billion announcement saying, we're investing 500 billion over four years. Um, but it's, it's not necessarily all, you know, like iPhone production lines or anything like that. It's about building servers and certain factories and, and spending on uh other things uh, within video. It's about uh, producing some of their blackwell chips at TSMC plants uh in Arizona. Um, but this isn't, you know, uh, a wholesale movement of uh, Nvidia's supply chain or, or any company's supply chain to the US and, and that's just not going to happen anytime soon. In fact, uh, a number of analysts that I spoke with basically said, look, you know, this is a way for these companies to kind of play the game uh, and ensure that they're on Trump's good side, uh, while also making kind of strategic investments. Obviously TSMC has been building uh, plants. They have their $165 billion earmarked for plants in Arizona, uh, companies like uh, AMD, uh, Nvidia, as I mentioned, Apple, uh, they're using those plants to build these chips, but it's not the volume that, you know, is going to the, the type of volume that's going to fulfill all the needs of, of the the US, let alone the world. And, you know, I think uh, this is, as I said, more about strategic relationships with Trump than anything else.\n\nSo is it really possible to deglobalize the tech industry? And what type of risks are we talking about here?\n\nYeah, I, I mean, look, it's, it's not, right? I mean, look at uh, uh, uh things like just silicon, right? The, the actual wafers themselves come from different parts of the world. I mean, you just break down a semiconductor and all of these pieces, it's, it's a global industry. That's, it's impossible to move these things just into the US. That's, that's wild. Uh, and so that's just the chips, right? And then you look at everything else that use the, the, the chips, right? Smartphones, um, uh, if you want to try to build iPhones in America, you can maybe do the final assembly here, but you still have different pieces coming from different parts of the world. And it's not just, you know, Southeast Asia and China, though, that's where uh, a huge majority of the, the, the pieces come from. It's also areas of Europe and, and South America, things along those lines. So it, this is something that uh, appears to be more of a fool's errand than anything else. Uh, it's more about, look, we, the Biden administration had this idea of ensuring that there was more semiconductor capacity in the US, which, which makes sense, but semiconductor capacity means building the chips. There's more steps to just building the chips. There's the silicon, there's the packaging, uh, those need other plants, not, it's not just like, you know, you push in a bunch of like a silicon wafer and outcomes a chip that you then drop into a computer. It's much more complicated than that. And so it is truly a global supply chain. There's, there's really no way to fully onshore all of tech manufacturing, let alone a piece of tech manufacturing like that.\n\nAnd you make a great point in that it's all waves back to the, it's everything from the natural resources in the type of silicon you're being able to get in the raw materials, all the way through the packaging, the product, the lithography that takes place as well. Uh, so much to consider here. Dan, thanks so much for bringing this down for us.\n\nFor sure.",

    "title": "There are 'definitely buying opportunities' in the tech sell-off",
    "content": "Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and ASML (ASML) are dragging the market lower as investors weigh the impact of the US-China trade war and a potential economic slowdown fueled by US President Trump's policies.\n\nSummit Global Investments chief investment officer David Harden sits down with Madison Mills and Brad Smith to discuss how to play the tech sector, comparing Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL).\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.\n\nIt's time now for today's strategy session. US stocks opening in the red this morning with tech leading the losses here. Options data showing investors are positioning for further losses in mega cap tech and semis ahead of earnings. That's according to data from Bloomberg. Joining us now with more, David Harden, Summit Global Investments CIO. David, great to speak with you this morning. Certainly a lot of pain for the big tech names this morning.\n\nThank you.\n\nAre you buying big tech at these levels?\n\nWell, I think there's some definitely buying opportunities that are coming available. For example, one of the things that I like is Google. Google has $25 billion in free cash flows last quarter. It's it's it's growing at double digits year-over-year. Its profit margins are great. Its return on equity is around 30%. And the PE is now finally getting down into those reasonable levels you can consider 16, 17, 15. So I think I think these are buying opportunities to start accumulating more positions in something like a Google.\n\nI think what you're highlighting is the, you know, this one thing is not like the other in the tech trade even as you're looking at what is more of a platform play where there's perhaps more of a reason to believe that the consumers would flow into free products that a Google might offer online versus what we're seeing in some of the products and propensity to spend in some of the other tech plays where there might be a consumer pullback in those discretionary dollars. How do you continue to look across these companies once we get into earnings and see how they're forecasting and guiding for the rest of the year on that?\n\nYeah, I think that's really important because where did their earnings come from, right? And and how are they tied to tariffs? That's really important. And how does those tariffs impact like advertising for Google. So you want to look kind of through those earnings into the consumer and and see what that consumer's doing and how that consumer's acting. And I think that's another play in tech. There is a separation. What? Are they hardware? Like Apple's had to navigate a lot more tariff news than Google's had to navigate, even though they're both navigating it.\n\nAnd we're starting to see individual companies being used as tools in this trade war. Obviously with Nvidia's specific chips being impacted by export controls, to what extent does that change any fundamental view you have on these stocks or should investors look past any of that daily headline news on tariffs?\n\nI I I think absolutely, you have to consider that and you have to manage your your risk here. Risk is really, really important in these markets and managing that is essential. So where you have the H20 chip, for example, invidia, they have clearly shown last night on their earnings that they have a difficult time more difficult time than some of these other tech names. So look for tech names that are more US based. Look for tech names that have more um say high-quality earnings. Even though somebody could question Google's high quality earnings, their earnings scores are not very good, but it is more US based. It is more consumer based in the US. And so that's very, very important in tech.\n\nIt seems like we've all been asking the question of what's the next big catalyst to drive conviction within the markets. Does that mean the AI trade or the fast-paced growth cycle for the AI trade is dead?\n\nNo, I don't think so because let's face it. Probably 10 minutes ago you were looking at AI, or I was looking at AI, or somebody was looking at some agent and the and the new things that are coming out with AI agents and things of this nature are absolutely impactful. The power of AI is growing. It's not shrinking. We're using it more. And it will continue to spread. So I think that trade's not done. I think there'll continue to be infrastructure build outs and AI things, but it has to go past just the technology. You have to look into the in industrial side of tech and where are they putting and building these centers at.\n\nI want to get to one of your cells, but first really quickly, would you buy Nvidia at these levels?\n\nUh probably not right now. No. I would be if you're if you're in it, it's time to hold and be patient. But if you're looking to buy, I think there's better opportunities to buy.\n\nAnd I know one of them is Microsoft, correct?\n\nI if you're looking at the two comparison, yes, Microsoft today, Nvidia's down more 6-7%, Microsoft's down in one, one and a half right now. I I think that's a safer play. It's a little bit more if if you will ingrained in our society. The revenues are are more um consistent. And so that's something that I would look at is more something like a Google or Microsoft. Both of those I would consider buying opportunities, especially at these levels.\n\nAnd I know a sell for you is one member of the mag 7. Talk to us about Tesla.\n\nWell, I think Tesla's had some negative earnings. We know that and um it's under pressure. I think every Tesla's uh I I saw a sticker on the back of a Tesla the other day that said something like, I bought this post crazy. So this is this is very, very important right now in our society. But having said that, I think Elon Musk is going to tell you when it's the right time to buy Tesla. And he hasn't done that yet. So he he's outspoken. We know what he's capable of. And until he's ready to let us know it's the right time to buy, I think it's you avoid that stock right now.\n\nOutside of tech, where's your favorite trade, your top idea right now?\n\nAnd I think I think outside of tech, you're going to have to look at some of the healthcare companies that have really been hurt with the Pharmatech news and other things.\n\nIt seems like they're next though in the docket for what potential tariffs may look like.\n\nOh, absolutely. So look for those healthcare companies that are not necessarily tied to pharma and they get their revenue, surgical centers and other places that are hospital-based, that are US-based, that we are going to use on a daily basis, but really are not tied to that. Those are the ones that have been kind of the baby been thrown out with the bath water. Their their valuations are very good right now.\n\nAbsolutely. David, great to see you here in studio. Thanks for taking the time with us this morning.\n\nThank you.\n\nAbsolutely.",

According to AMD, the new export rules apply to the company's MI308 GPUs.\n\n\"On April 15, 2025, [AMD] completed its initial assessment of a new license requirement implemented by the [U.S.] government for the export of certain semiconductor products to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and D:5 countries,\" AMD wrote in the filing. \"The [export control] applies to [AMD's] MI308 products.
