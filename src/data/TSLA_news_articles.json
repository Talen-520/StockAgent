    "title": "Cramer on Tesla (TSLA): Surging Beyond EVs with Robotaxis and Musk’s Influence",
    "content": [
      "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discussed These 29 Stocks Ahead Of Major AI Event. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against other stocks ahead of major AI event that Jim Cramer discussed.",
      "In his appearance on Squawk on the Street the day CES took place in Las Vegas, Jim Cramer commented on the stock market division that persisted throughout 2024 and is present in 2025 as well. The division has seen technology stocks perform well, while other rate-sensitive sectors such as industrial and materials stocks have languished. Cramer commented on the reasons behind it: “I think that’s because people perceive that the rest of the market is hostage to rates. And that tech is not hostage to anything. So I’m aware of that and I’m just concerned that you have this speech tonight, nine-thirty Jensen Huang, everyone’s, we’re really kind of, whatever he says, is going to move things.”",
      "In fact, this division is so prevalent that some of the biggest asset managers in the world have also been unable to remain immune to it. Mentioning a piece in the Financial Times, Cramer shared that it commented about “private equity and private equity trying to get into the 401(k) business.” He added and mentioned, “Marc Rowan CEO of Apollo says, I jokingly say sometimes we levered the entire retirement [inaudible] to NVIDIA’s performance! So [inaudible] we’ve got the NVIDIAs of the world which everybody likes and on the other hand, there’s these stocks are, they really are hostage to rates and no one wants them!”",
      "However, even though technology stocks have stood the test of high interest rates, they might falter in some circumstances. One of these can be bond yields, and if the thirty-year yield spikes to 5%, then Cramer believes “that will start interfering with this tech rally that seems to be motivated by a lot of analysts coming out and saying this is the time, there’s now reacceleration in tech spend.”",
      "The CNBC host also speculated on what Jensen Huang might end up talking about at CES later in the day. He stated “I think that one of the things that Jensen is going to talk about today are all the new use cases. This is tonight’s CES talk. It wouldn’t surprise me if we start hearing about robots. It wouldn’t surprise me if we didn’t hear a lot about Tesla. Tesla and self-driving cars. Tesla and the neural network that is based on NVIDIA!”",
      "Along with industrial and material stocks, another sector that’s caught Cramer’s attention is banks. Mentioning a recent investment bank note about the sector he believes that “one of the groups that I think we have to focus on, there’s a really interesting, uh, Barclays piece on the banks. Darkest before dawn. Raising the group for the first time since 2019, emphasis here on Citi.”",
      "Cramer also outlined that while technology valuations might appear to be overstretched, this isn’t the case with banks. He shared “This is a group that when you look at it, they’re selling at 11 times 2026 numbers. So the idea that you have this valuation problem in the market, well look at these stocks! There’s no valuation problem with materials. Or with banks.” He added “The valuation problem is with the stuff that keeps getting upgraded, which is enterprise software. So there’s a little duplicitous nature among the top people who work at these firms because they should be saying look, there are two markets. There’s the inexpensive market and we’re warming up to it, and the expensive market, and we don’t know what to do.”",
      "To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired on Monday.",
      "For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).",
      "Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 99",
      "Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the world’s largest pure-play electric vehicle manufacturer. However, unlike other EV companies like Lucid Motors and Rivian, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s narrative is broader and depends on other factors such as robotaxis, assisted-driving technologies, and its CEO’s relationship with the incoming Trump Administration. The EV slowdown drove Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s in 2024 up until the November election. Ahead of the election, the stock was up by just 1%, but since then, the shares have gained 57%. Cramer also commented on the non-EV factors ‘driving’ Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s stock as he shared:",
      "Overall, TSLA ranks 5th on our list of stocks ahead of major AI event that Jim Cramer discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSLA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.",

      "Tesla has decided to recall approximately 239,000 vehicles due to a defect that could prevent the rear-view camera from displaying an image, Reuters reported.",
      "The issue is expected to be resolved through an over-the-air software update, the report said.",
      "This recall comes shortly after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) initiated an investigation into 2.6 million Tesla vehicles in the US, following reports of accidents involving a feature that allows users to remotely move their cars.",
      "In a limited number of the affected vehicles, a reverse current might occur during the power-up process, potentially leading to a short circuit on the vehicle's computer board. This could render the rear-view camera non-functional, the company explained.",
      "Tesla has committed to identifying any vehicles with the circuit board issue and will replace the computer at no cost to the owner.",
      "The company began an investigation after noting \"an increase in car computer replacements\" due to short circuit problems in November.",
      "The investigation revealed that certain software and hardware configurations, especially in colder temperatures, could lead to an increase in reverse current, raising the risk of a short in power components.",
      "To prevent the issue, Tesla stated that Model 3, Model S, and Model X vehicles in production have been equipped with a different car computer variant since 16 December 2024.",
      "The recall affects Model 3 and Model S vehicles from the years 2024-25, as well as Model X and Model Y vehicles from 2023-25.",

    "title": "Elon Musk Is The Richest Man In The World Leaving Jeff Bezos Trailing $237 Billion Behind – Being Buddies With Trump Likely Driving Surge",
    "content": [
      "Last year, Elon Musk teetered back and forth with Jeff Bezos for the title of the richest person in the world. One day it was Musk, the next it was Bezos and sometimes the gap between them seemed razor-thin. But today, there's no contest. Musk's fortune has skyrocketed to an eye-watering $486 billion, leaving Bezos far behind at $233.5 billion – a staggering $237 billion gap, according to Fortune. It's not just the largest gap in their rivalry – it's the largest gap ever recorded between the two wealth titans.",
      "Don't Miss:",
      "The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.",
      "‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum.",
      "But how did Musk leave Bezos in the dust? Sure, Tesla and SpaceX are booming, but this story is about more than electric cars and space rockets. It's about timing, politics and Musk's surprising new alliance with President-elect Donald Trump – a relationship that's turning heads and raising eyebrows.",
      "Musk wasn't always a Trump supporter. In fact, during Trump's first presidency, he was openly critical of the administration. But as the 2024 election drew closer, Musk's stance shifted. According to a November BBC article, Musk described himself as \"politically moderate\" but said he felt compelled to back Trump, citing concerns about the economy, immigration and free speech under another Democratic presidency.",
      "See Also: Elon Musk Told The U.N. If They Could Show A Plan For Ending World Hunger He'd Donate $6 Billion – ‘I Will Sell Tesla Stock Right Now And Do It'",
      "Musk didn't just voice his support; he poured money and influence into Trump's campaign. He donated $119 million to a pro-Trump Super PAC and launched an ambitious get-out-the-vote effort in battleground states, offering $1 million in giveaways to voters every day leading up to Election Day. Initially challenged in court, the giveaways ultimately went forward and dominated headlines.",
      "For Musk, this wasn't just about politics – it was about positioning himself for the future. His bet paid off in a big way. Emboldened by Trump's pro-business policies, investors flocked to Musk's companies. According to CNBC, Tesla stock surged 69% after Trump's victory, with Wall Street rallying behind Trump's promises to support autonomous vehicles and electric car adoption. Similarly, SpaceX saw its valuation balloon to $350 billion as confidence grew that Trump's administration would prioritize defense contracts and private space exploration – both areas where SpaceX reigns supreme.",
      "Beyond Wall Street, Musk's influence is also growing in Washington. Trump has already tapped him to cochair the newly created \"Department of Government Efficiency\" (DOGE), giving Musk a hand in shaping federal policies. Supporters hail the move as a win for innovation, arguing Musk's business savvy could bring much-needed change to outdated government systems. Critics, however, see it as dangerous, warning that Musk's dual role as a billionaire business owner and policymaker could lead to conflicts of interest and unchecked power.",
      "Trending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.",
      "While Musk's wealth has soared, Bezos seems stuck in neutral. According to Forbes, with a net worth of $233.5 billion, Bezos is still the second-richest person in the world, but the gap between him and Musk has never been wider. Bezos says he is fine with being second and has never set out to be the richest man in the world, as he explained back in 2018 when he was asked about this title at the Economic Club of Washington.",
      "Musk's rise isn't just a story about money – it's about power. With his newfound political alliance and a fortune that dwarfs everyone else's, Musk is reshaping what it means to be a billionaire in America. Supporters view him as a visionary, using his resources to tackle humanity's biggest challenges. Critics, however, worry about the risks of concentrating so much wealth and influence in one person's hands.",
      "For now, though, one thing is clear: Musk isn't just dominating the wealth race – he's rewriting the rules entirely. Bezos may still be a titan, but Musk is on a trajectory that's out of this world and his friendship with Trump might just be the fuel propelling him to unprecedented heights.",

      "Tesla's full self-driving version 13 shows significant improvements, and a robotaxi service deployment in California and Texas is anticipated in the second or third quarter, on the back of its AI capabilities.",
      "Vehicle deliveries are forecast to grow 15% in 2025, driven by new models, including the \"Model Q,\" and refreshed designs. However, first-quarter deliveries may fall below consensus due to minimal contributions from new models.",

      "Tesla finally revealed one of its best-kept secrets, pulling back the cloth on a refreshed newer version of its bestselling Model Y.",
      "It’s hard to overstate just how high the stakes are for CEO Elon Musk, whose company just suffered a historic drop in annual sales.",
      "The midsize crossover is the brand’s bestseller by far. Last year, it accounted for roughly 1.2 million units delivered, or two out of every three cars Tesla sold. Yet the vehicle faces increasing competition as it enters its sixth year in the U.S. market.",
      "Due out first in China come March, the newer vehicle, code-named “Juniper,” is now available to order on Tesla’s local website.",
      "It touches up some exterior styling cues including headlights that borrow heavily from the Cybercab robotaxi concept, while offering more extensive changes in the passenger cabin.",
      "The long-range version, better suited for American roads, retails at 303,500 yuan ($41,400) and manages 719 kilometers (447 miles) on one charge under China’s far more forgiving test cycle. The latter represents a slight improvement of 4.5% over the current version.",
      "The U.S. launch date, price in dollars, and EPA-estimated range have not been released, but they are likely to be substantially different if for no other reason than Tesla sources the bulk of its made-in-China vehicles locally.",
      "Tesla did not respond to a Fortune request for comment.",
      "A lot is riding on Juniper’s success. No other major global carmaker is so heavily dependent on just one product to drive overall revenue and profits, let alone a company worth more than the rest of its collective peers combined.",
      "Even a moderate drop in demand would have a material effect on Tesla’s business, especially as the EV maker’s launch date for its low-cost entry model is not exactly clear.",
      "Investors hope Juniper will reignite demand enough to keep Tesla factories humming with a minimum of margin-eroding rebates and incentives.",
      "A key reason both production and deliveries sank last year was the belief that Model Y owners were waiting for Juniper’s arrival before submitting their next purchasing order.",
      "“To achieve the envisaged accelerated sales growth in 2025, the new entry model is essential in our view,” UBS said, referring to Musk’s promise to grow volumes by 20% to 30% this year.",
      "Notably, the look differs from that of its sibling, the Model 3 “Highland,” whose front grille and headlights are more minor refinements from the original design.",
      "Juniper’s front features the same single light bar stretching across the hood that first featured on the Cybertruck pickup before it was grafted onto the body of a conventional passenger car with the Cybercab.",
      "The refreshed Model Y’s rear also includes a light bar borrowed from the robotaxi, but is much fatter in appearance.",
      "Oddly enough, one of the most controversial aspects is the apparent continued presence of an indicator stalk.",
      "This ubiquitous instrument was replaced when the Y’s sibling, the Model 3 Highland, underwent its design upgrade.",
      "In keeping with Musk’s philosophy that “the best part is no part,” drivers were instead told they would now have to press a button when signaling a turn.",
      "The decision proved highly divisive among the CEO’s otherwise fiercely loyal customer base.",
      "But indicators are safety-relevant, and stalks are intuitive.",
      "By comparison, signaling buttons can more easily be mixed up while driving.",
      "If Juniper retains a stalk, it would be a rare example of Tesla completely reversing course.",
      "Whether the changes are sufficient enough to deliver the boost Tesla needs remains unclear. But even as it props up demand from returning customers, it may fail to poach new ones from rival brands.",
      "“For competitors in the segment, we would not see the Model Y facelift as a game changer,” UBS concluded.",

    "title": "Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
    "content": [
      "Tesla (TSLA) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.",
      "Over the past month, shares of this electric car maker have returned -5.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which Tesla falls in, has lost 4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?",
      "While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.",
      "Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.",
      "Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.",
      "Tesla is expected to post earnings of $0.76 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.5%.",
      "The consensus earnings estimate of $2.46 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -21.2%. This estimate has changed -0.6% over the last 30 days.",
      "For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.27 indicates a change of +33% from what Tesla is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%.",
      "Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Tesla is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",
      "The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:",
      "Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.",
      "In the case of Tesla, the consensus sales estimate of $27.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.5%. The $99.89 billion and $117.25 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +3.2% and +17.4%, respectively.",
      "Tesla reported revenues of $25.18 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.9%. EPS of $0.72 for the same period compares with $0.66 a year ago.",
      "Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25.55 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.45%. The EPS surprise was +24.14%.",
      "Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.",
      "Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.",
      "Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.",
      "As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.",
      "Tesla is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.",
      "The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Tesla. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.",
