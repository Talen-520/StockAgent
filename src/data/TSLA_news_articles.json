    "title": "Why Tesla (TSLA) Is Among the Best Stocks to Buy and Hold for 3 Years?",
    "content": [
      "We recently published a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold For 3 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against the other best stocks to buy and hold for 3 years.",
      "On December 12, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, joined CNBC's 'Closing Bell' to discuss his playbook for 2025. Following two years of significant gains, his playbook suggests an optimistic yet cautious outlook for the stock market next year. Lee anticipates that the S&P 500 will rise to approximately 7,000 by mid-2025, before retreating to around 6,600 by the end of the year. This reflects an overall expected increase of about 8% for the year, which is consistent with historical averages for stock market returns. In terms of Earnings Per Share (EPS) estimates Lee projects EPS for the S&P 500 at $260 in 2025 while estimating $300 for 2026. This is slightly below the consensus estimates from Wall Street, which average around $268 for 2025.",

      "Explaining his investment thesis, Lee pointed towards several themes that could drive the market in 2025. He predicts a \"tale of two halves,\" where the first half of the year will see stronger market performance due to factors like Federal Reserve policies and business-friendly initiatives under President Trump. Conversely, he expects a pullback in the second half, reflecting historical trends after strong consecutive years. He sees potential in small-cap stocks, which have underperformed relative to large-cap stocks historically. Lee also talked about the mega caps that are leading. He mentioned that investors reach for these companies when there is even slight risk in the market. Secondly, mega-cap stocks are highly sensitive to falling interest rates. With the December cut in effect, the market is bullish for tech, thereby further solidifying the investment case for megacaps.",
      "Despite his generally positive outlook, Lee acknowledges several risks that could impact market performance. For instance, he thinks the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could potentially lead to reduced government spending and slower economic growth if it is too effective in cutting costs. Moreover, the implementation of tariffs could adversely affect economic conditions and corporate profits. Lee pointed out that historical patterns suggest that after two years of substantial gains, markets often experience declines in the latter half of the third year.",
      "To compile the list of 10 best stocks to buy and hold for 3 years, we applied a consensus approach. We sifted through recent articles to get an aggregated list of the best stocks to buy and hold for 3 years. Next, we ranked these stocks based on the number of hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024, sourced from Insider Monkey’s database.",
      "Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).",
      "Number of Hedge Funds: 99",
      "Tesla, Inc.  (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the best stocks to buy and hold for 3 years. It is one of the pioneers in the electric vehicle industry. It creates various fully electric cars, including popular models like the Model 3, Model Y, Model S, Model X, and the Cyber Truck. It also designs products related to solar energy including energy storage systems like the Powerwall (for homes) and Megapack (for larger applications), which store energy for later use.",
      "The company delivered approximately 462,890 vehicles in Q3 2024, marking a significant increase from the previous year and setting a record for third-quarter volumes. It also benefited from other automakers' struggle to meet emissions standards and marked the second-highest revenue from regulatory credits. More importantly, the cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle dropped to around $35,100, the lowest level ever for the company.",
      "The company is making significant advancements in its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology, claiming a 1,000-fold improvement in critical interventions within the software this year. It plans to launch an unsupervised version of its FSD software and introduce a ride-hailing service in California and Texas by 2025. This will be a significant development for the company because as per Grand View Research, FSD vehicle sales are expected to reach $214 billion by 2030, and the management believes the technology can take the company’s gross margins to 70%.",
      "Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:",
      "Overall, TSLA ranks 6th on our list of best stocks to buy and hold for 3 years. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSLA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.",

    "content": [
      "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.",
      "Elon Musk wasn't always the polarizing figure we see today in climate discussions. Once celebrated as a green-tech pioneer, Musk was vocal about the urgent need to combat climate change. In 2006, he described Tesla's mission as a way to \"help expedite the move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy toward a solar electric economy.\" In 2015, he warned of the devastating consequences of delaying this transition. “The worst case,” he said, “is more displacement and destruction than all the wars in history combined.”",
      "At the time, Musk painted a grim picture of the future if humanity failed to act. He specifically talked about the dangers of rising sea levels, warning that oceanfront property would become “a lot less valuable” as floods destroyed homes and businesses.",

      "In his first appearance on the Joe Rogan Podcast in 2018, Musk stressed how strong the scientific agreement on climate change is, saying, “The scientific consensus is overwhelming. I mean, I don’t know any serious scientists – zero, literally zero – who don’t think that we have quite a serious climate risk that we’re facing.”",
      "His past concerns align with findings from a Climate Central study, which revealed that nearly 650,000 parcels of oceanfront property in the U.S. currently sitting on dry land will be at least partially submerged within 30 years due to rising sea levels. This shift will devastate property owners and strain cities and counties that rely on property taxes to fund schools, emergency services and utilities.",

      "He even described the risk of climate change as “not as high as a lot of people say it is,” framing the issue in terms of discomfort from high CO2 levels instead of catastrophic dangers scientists have long warned about. This change in attitude has left people wondering why Musk, who once called for urgent action, now seems so dismissive.",
      "Musk's pivot has not gone unnoticed. Critics point to his embrace of right-wing politicians and climate denialism as a key factor. On X (formerly Twitter), a platform he owns, climate scientists have been leaving in droves, citing a surge in misinformation about global warming. Musk's partner in DOGE, the prospective agency tasked with cutting government costs, Vivek Ramaswamy, previously called climate change a “hoax.”",
      "Musk’s behavior presents a conflicting image. On the one hand, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has revolutionized the electric vehicle market and Musk’s endeavors, such as the $100 million Xprize for carbon removal, demonstrate his dedication to creative solutions. However, his personal carbon footprint undermined his message, as his private jet logged a whopping 441 flights in 2023, emitting 5,159 tonnes of CO2, according to JetSpy.",

      "Then there's his claim that CO2 levels would only become a problem at 1,000 parts per million (ppm), much higher than today's 420 ppm. Scientists quickly debunked this, explaining that society would collapse long before CO2 reached those levels, as extreme weather, rising sea levels and food shortages would create chaos. Musk's mix-up of indoor air quality standards with outdoor atmospheric CO2 measurements shows a serious misunderstanding of basic science.",
      "This evolution – or perhaps devolution – has left many wondering: What changed? Some suggest Musk's interests now lie more in maintaining relationships in conservative circles than in driving climate advocacy. For example, President-elect Donald Trump said climate change is not \"the biggest threat\" and claimed it would create \"more oceanfront property.\" Others speculate that his sprawling business empire and the demands of his ventures have pulled him away from his once-clear mission.",

    "title": "Is Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) A Risky Investment?",
    "content": [
      "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We note that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.",
      "Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.",
      "See our latest analysis for Tesla",
      "As you can see below, at the end of September 2024, Tesla had US$7.39b of debt, up from US$3.70b a year ago. Click the image for more detail. However, it does have US$33.6b in cash offsetting this, leading to net cash of US$26.3b.",
      "The latest balance sheet data shows that Tesla had liabilities of US$30.6b due within a year, and liabilities of US$18.6b falling due after that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$33.6b and US$3.48b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities total US$12.0b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.",
      "This state of affairs indicates that Tesla's balance sheet looks quite solid, as its total liabilities are just about equal to its liquid assets. So while it's hard to imagine that the US$1.35t company is struggling for cash, we still think it's worth monitoring its balance sheet. While it does have liabilities worth noting, Tesla also has more cash than debt, so we're pretty confident it can manage its debt safely.",
      "It is just as well that Tesla's load is not too heavy, because its EBIT was down 24% over the last year. Falling earnings (if the trend continues) could eventually make even modest debt quite risky. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Tesla's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.",
      "Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. Tesla may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. During the last three years, Tesla produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 52% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.",
      "We could understand if investors are concerned about Tesla's liabilities, but we can be reassured by the fact it has has net cash of US$26.3b. So we are not troubled with Tesla's debt use. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. To that end, you should learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Tesla (including 1 which is potentially serious) .",

    "title": "3 Bold Stock Market Predictions for 2025",
    "content": [
      "The year is almost over, and it's time to make some bold predictions for 2025.",
      "In this article, three Motley Fool contributors draw on their experience to forecast what may be in store for the stock market next year. Here's what they have to say about Artificial Intelligence (AI) software stocks, Ark Innovation ETF, the Magnificent Seven, and more!",
      "Jake Lerch (AI software stocks): My prediction is that 2025 will be the year of software stocks. Think about it: Hardware stocks were some of the top-performing stocks of 2024. Semiconductor companies like Nvidia, Broadcom, and ARM Holdings saw their stocks skyrocket as demand for high-powered chips went through the roof.",
      "However, as the calendar turns from 2024 to 2025, I predict that the stock market may begin to shift its attention away from chip stocks and toward software stocks like SoundHound AI and Palantir.",
      "Indeed, over the last few months, a shift has already started, with the stocks of application-makers like SoundHound and Palantir outpacing semiconductor stocks like Nvidia and AMD.",
      "What's more, some of these software companies remain relatively small in terms of market cap. As of this writing, SoundHound AI sports a market cap of about $8 billion. That makes it a potential acquisition target for deep-pocketed tech mega-caps. For example, Meta Platforms has over $70 billion in cash on hand -- more than enough to snap up SoundHound with tens of billions in cash left over.",
      "But it's not just the upstarts that could benefit from the shifting focus to software. Companies in the digital advertising and digital learning spaces could also benefit as stock market participants look beyond AI hardware to some of its practical applications. Reddit is testing an AI-powered answering tool that could help the company draw more users -- and ad dollars. Learning app Duolingo is expanding beyond language learning by incorporating music and math lessons. Those new lessons -- powered by AI -- will help Duolingo attract more users and subscribers.",
      "In short, the everyday uses of AI are nearly limitless -- and they're just starting to roll out. Because of that, I predict 2025 will be the year that AI-powered software shines bright.",
      "Will Healy (Ark Innovation ETF): Although many investors profited from the latest bull market, the rally was not broad-based. Instead, most of the benefit went to the top stocks. One can see this when comparing the performance of the S&P 500 over the last two years to that of the Russell 2000.",
      "This has worked against Cathie Wood's Ark Innovation ETF (NYSEMKT: ARKK), as most of its holdings are not S&P 500 stocks. The ETF is up by just over 20% this year, and all of that gain occurred following the U.S. presidential election.",
      "Fortunately for Ark Holdings, many of these stocks left behind by the current rally seemed to move off their lows in recent weeks. As interest rates fall and post-election optimism rises, this should bode well for Cathie Wood's flagship ETF.",
      "To see this, one only has to look at its holdings. Of its top 10 positions, only Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Palantir (NASDAQ: PLTR) are S&P 500 stocks. However, the recovery is now trickling down to the non-S&P holdings.",
      "For example, its second-largest holding, Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU), makes up more than 9% of the fund and appeared to miss most of the current tech rally. While Roku is still more than 80% lower than its 2021 high, its stock has risen by over 60% from its August low, an improvement helping the Ark Innovation ETF.",
      "The improvement is more profound for fourth place holding Roblox (NYSE: RBLX), which is around 6% of the Ark Innovation ETF. Although that stock has stagnated since the 2022 bear market, it has doubled in value from its May low. The rally started even earlier for a stock that is 5% of the fund, Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ: HOOD), which is up over 240% this year!",
      "Such improvements are indicators that the tech rally has finally moved beyond the Magnificent Seven and other top stocks. As we move into 2025 and the rest of the tech sector finally begins to rally, a long-awaited recovery for the Ark Innovation ETF appears to be at hand.",
      "Justin Pope (Magnificent Seven): Anyone with investment exposure to the Magnificent Seven stocks, including Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla, has likely enjoyed the past two years. The Magnificent Seven represents approximately 32% of the S&P 500 index, so their widespread outperformance has helped carry the stock market.",
      "My 2025 prediction is that some of these names will start running out of steam.",
      "These companies lead or compete in a handful of high-growth end markets, including e-commerce, digital advertising, cloud computing, semiconductors, artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and more. If you're investing for the long term, the Magnificent Seven should still be a winning choice.",
      "However, some of these companies have risen so much that their valuations have gotten ahead of the underlying businesses, which could lead to a down year for some big names in 2025. For example, Apple's AI tech, Apple Intelligence, may not be the home run investors hoped for. Yet, the stock trades at 34 times earnings despite analysts forecasting under 10% annualized long-term growth. That's a pretty steep valuation.",
      "Tesla has rallied hard since the presidential election but trades at 177 times its earnings despite soft sales in its core vehicle business. Analysts estimate Tesla will grow earnings by 8% annually over the next several years, which is nowhere near enough to justify such a high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.",
      "Some Magnificent Seven names could keep running next year. Alphabet and Meta trade at P/E ratios of 24 and 27, respectively. Meanwhile, analysts believe they will each grow earnings by 16% to 18% annually over the long term. That's far more growth at a better price than you're getting from Apple and Tesla.",
      "The bottom line? Investors should pay close attention to the growth they're getting and the price they pay for it. Indiscriminately buying the Magnificent Seven has worked for two years, but that trend may soon end.",

    "content": [
      "Through the first 10 months of 2024, shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) were essentially flat despite the extreme volatility they exhibited. That was certainly troubling for investors to see, particularly when you consider that the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index was up 18% during that same period of time.",
      "But since the presidential election on Nov. 5, Tesla shares have rocketed 77% higher (as of Dec. 18). The booming EV stock now trades just 8% off its all-time record, as it benefits from tremendous momentum.",
      "Looking toward the future, let's see if Tesla is a millionaire maker?",
      "I definitely don't doubt that early Tesla shareholders have gotten rich off their holdings. In the past decade, the stock has soared 3,110%, a gain any investor would be excited about. This means that had you invested about $31,000 in Tesla in mid-December 2014, you'd be sitting on a cool $1 million today. This business has indeed been a millionaire-maker in the past.",
      "Tesla's rise can be attributed to its ability to disrupt the traditional auto industry. While the Model S sports sedan was first launched in 2012, the business now offers five total passenger vehicle models, all of which have unique designs and innovative tech features that consumers appreciate.",
      "Growth historically has been superb. Revenue totaled $25.2 billion in the third quarter (ended Sept. 30), up 300% compared to the same period five years earlier. At the same time, Tesla went from delivering 97,000 vehicle units in Q3 2019 to 463,000 in the latest quarter. This volume gives the company 17% global market share in the EV industry.",
      "It's also worth pointing out that Tesla's cost advantages, as well as its premium brand positioning, enable it to earn consistent profits. In the past five years, the quarterly gross margin and operating margin have averaged 19.9% and 10.2%, respectively. Tesla's bottom-line performance compares quite favorably to legacy automakers whose EV segments continue losing billions of dollars.",
      "Investors who have been on the sidelines watching Tesla's ascent wonder if the stock can keep its unbelievable streak going in the years ahead. It's easy to be critical in this regard.",
      "Tesla's latest stock surge is likely credited to founder and CEO Elon Musk's close ties with President-elect Donald Trump. With the hopes of favorable regulatory policies toward laws surrounding full self-driving (FSD) technology, the market could be anticipating a smooth path for Tesla.",
      "For what it's worth, the business has plans to launch ride-hailing services in California and Texas next year. But if the legal framework becomes more accommodating, maybe Tesla can make inroads into many more markets in the not-too-distant future.",
      "Even if you were bullish on the possibility of FSD capabilities becoming a commercial success through a combination of Tesla operating a company-owned robotaxi fleet and selling autonomous vehicles to the masses, it's hard to argue that this optimism isn't already fully baked into the current valuation.",
      "As of this writing, Tesla's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is an eye-watering 177. It's wild to think that at the start of the year, this multiple was just 27. Clearly, market sentiment has shifted in a dramatic way to the upside. When a forward P/E ratio is as high as Tesla's, there is undoubtedly zero margin of safety.",
      "Viewing the present with a clear lens, it's obvious that Tesla remains a car manufacturer that is exposed to macroforces and intense competition. This should help put things in perspective.",
      "While the leader in EVs has been a millionaire-maker in the past, for prospective investors looking to hop on the Tesla bandwagon now, I'm not confident it can get you into the seven-figure club if shares were purchased today. The valuation is just too high.",

    "title": "Will Tesla Stock Pop or Drop in 2025?",
    "content": [
      "Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has been one of the biggest surprises of 2024.",
      "The stock lagged the market for much of the year as the company reported disappointing quarterly results, including sluggish growth and falling profits. Additionally, electric vehicle sales growth has slowed as momentum in the sector seems to be plateauing now that early adopters have already purchased an EV, and EV stocks have struggled in general this year.",
      "Through Oct. 23, the stock was down 14% year to date, underperforming the S&P 500, which had gained 21%, by a wide margin, as the chart below shows.",
      "However, since then, the stock has been on fire. The company first impressed investors with its third-quarter earnings report, which showed strong profit growth, and CEO Elon Musk predicted that vehicle production would increase by 20% to 30% in 2025, a significant improvement from flat growth in 2024.",
      "Then, Tesla soared following the election as Musk's big bet on Trump seemed to pay off. Investors seem to be hopeful that the Trump administration will make it easier for Tesla to roll out its new Cybercab, also known as the robotaxi. Tesla is also planning to launch an affordably priced Model Q at under $30,000 in the first half of 2025. As you can see from the chart below, through Dec. 17, the stock is up a whopping 125% in less than two months.",
      "As you can see, Tesla is bringing a lot of momentum in the new year. So, will the stock keep gaining, or is it destined for a pullback? Here are a few things to watch.",
      "Tesla stock was already expensive before its recent rally, but its valuation now seems to have fully detached from the underlying business. The stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 200, which is much more expensive than any of its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers, none of which trade at a P/E above 51.",
      "At that price, it will be difficult for Tesla to meet expectations as a carmaker alone, as the company is already selling nearly 2 million vehicles a year. Those high expectations seemed to be based on Musk's own predictions for the company's autonomous vehicle business, as he said that Tesla would be the most valuable company in the world if its robotaxi marketplace takes off. Considering that the Cybercab hasn't yet gone into production and that there are regulatory hurdles for the company to overcome, it's certainly not guaranteed that its driverless cars will replace Uber as Musk has envisioned.",
      "Tesla stock has nearly doubled since the election, and Musk's chummy relationship with Trump is a major reason why. Musk spent hundreds of millions of dollars on Trump's campaign and appeared on stage with him several times. He's also been tapped to run the new Department of Government Efficiency, in charge of ferreting out government waste.",
      "However, Musk and Trump are unlikely bedfellows in some ways. First, Trump is known to support fossil fuels over green energy, and his administration has already indicated that it will eliminate the $7,500 EV tax credit. Musk has downplayed the effect of such a move, saying it's much worse for EV start-ups than it is for Tesla, but it's likely to shift some demand for EVs back to traditional combustion vehicles for price-sensitive consumers, which would be a negative for Tesla.",
      "The real opportunity for the EV maker is in autonomy, and the Trump administration has also indicated that it would ease rules around self-driving cars and establish a national standard, making it easier for Tesla to roll out the Cybercab, which does not have a steering wheel.",
      "However, safety will be the ultimate test of any autonomous vehicle, and if the cars are allowed on the road before they're ready, it could be a disaster for both Tesla and the Trump administration.",
      "Tesla is one of the more unpredictable companies, and its stock is notoriously volatile.",
      "However, it's entering the new year essentially priced for perfection at the current valuation. Autonomy is unlikely to have an impact as the company isn't planning on producing the Cybercab in 2026, though signs of progress could give the stock a boost.",
      "Instead, investor attention will be on the core business, the Model Q vehicle, and whether the Trump administration will be able to help the company in a material way.",
      "With Tesla already trading at a market cap of $1.5 trillion and a P/E ratio of 200, the stock seems more likely to underperform than not next year, despite the current investor enthusiasm.",
      "Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.",

    "title": "Meet the Supercharged Growth Stock That's One of This Year's Biggest Winners. The Company Could Hit $50 Trillion by 2034, According to 1 World-Renowned Analyst",
    "content": [
      "James Anderson may not be a household name, but there's no denying the legendary investor has made his mark. He spent more than two decades with the Scottish investment management firm Baillie Gifford, directing its premiere Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust and raking up gains of 1,700% in the process. He's now a managing partner at Lingotto Investment Management.",
      "He made his name by spotting early and betting heavily on some of the tech sector's most iconic companies, including Amazon, Tesla, and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), among others. So when Anderson talks, investors would do well to listen.",
      "Earlier this year, Anderson made a bold prognostication, saying that if the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) continues at its current pace, Nvidia could be worth as much as $50 trillion 10 years from now. While that might seem a fantastical assertion at first glance, he makes a compelling case.",
      "Let's take a look at the factors that could drive Nvidia's value to that unthinkable height.",
      "There's no denying the impact AI has had on Nvidia's fortunes over the past couple of years, but it's worth reviewing recent history to provide some context. In just the past 12 months or so, the company's market cap has soared from $1.2 trillion to $3.2 trillion (as of this writing) -- adding $2 trillion to its value. This all came about because the company's most powerful graphics processing units (GPU) have become the gold standard for AI processing.",
      "Nvidia's results have been phenomenal. It generated five consecutive quarters of triple-digit percentage growth before it inevitably ran up against tough comps. Despite that, in its fiscal 2025 third quarter (which ended Oct. 27), Nvidia still grew its revenues by 94% year over year to $35 billion. This resulted in its diluted earnings per share (EPS) soaring by 103% to $0.81.",
      "During the first nine months of its fiscal 2025 (which ends in late January), Nvidia has generated revenue of $91 billion, and it's on track to surpass $129 billion for the year. Sales of that magnitude would have been unimaginable just a few years ago.",
      "For example, the $35 billion in revenue Nvidia generated in its most recent quarter far eclipsed the $27 billion in sales it generated for all of its fiscal 2023.",
      "Yet these monumental gains could be just the beginning. The AI market could conceivably be worth $15.7 trillion by 2030, according to analysts at PwC, who also noted that \"AI is still at a very early stage.\" If Nvidia reaps just a sliver of that addressable market, its sales and profits could continue to soar.",
      "Anderson suggests that demand for AI chips used in data centers -- where most AI processing takes place -- is currently increasing by about 60% annually. Assuming that this growth continues at the same pace, and that Nvidia is able to maintain its profit margins over the course of a decade, in 20234, that would give it an EPS of $1,350. At that point, Nvidia would be worth about $20,000 per share, translating to a market cap of roughly $49 trillion, according to Anderson.",
      "There's no denying that Amazon and Tesla have both been extraordinarily profitable investments. Amazon stock has gained 229,200% since its IPO, while Tesla is up more than 27,000%. Anderson notes, however, that these opportunities were different because these companies \"didn't start from highly profitable and dominant positions but had to get there.\"",
      "There's no denying Nvidia's dominance. It still has the leading share of the gaming chips market that started it all. In the calendar third quarter, Nvidia's share of the desktop GPU market climbed to 90%, as its graphics cards remain the go-to choice for gamers everywhere.",
      "Nvidia also dominates the data center space. The company boasted a 98% market share in data center GPUs in both 2022 and 2023. While most expect its share price to moderate in 2024 in the face of increasing competition in the AI chip segment, it's still expected to be the undisputed market leader.",
      "Its market dominance aside, there are other reasons Anderson is bullish on Nvidia. The company's \"persistent exponential progress, the competitive advantages in hardware and software, and the culture and leadership are exactly what we look for,\" he noted.",
      "It's worth running the numbers to see what it would take for Nvidia to reach a value of $50 trillion, as unlikely as it might be. Nvidia currently has a market cap of roughly $3.2 trillion, so it would take a stock price gain of 1,458% to drive its value to $50 trillion.",
      "Wall Street expects Nvidia to generate revenue of roughly $129 billion in its fiscal 2025, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of about 25. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Nvidia would need to grow its revenue to roughly $2 trillion annually to support a $50 trillion market cap. Wall Street is predicting revenue of $195 billion next year. Using that as a starting point, Nvidia would have to grow its revenue by 35% annually until 2034 to generate revenue of $2 trillion. While that's a high bar, it's certainly possible.",
      "Fun with math aside, there is a long list of potential issues that could derail Nvidia on its unlikely path to $50 trillion:",
      "Widespread AI adoption fails to materialize.",
      "Significant competition emerges, reducing Nvidia's market share.",
      "Nvidia suffers another innovation stumble.",
      "A black swan event occurs.",
      "An economic deterioration occurs.",
      "Supplier disagreements or defections impede its production.",
      "There are many more potential roadblocks, but you get the picture.",
      "Anderson was very clear to point out (italics mine), \"This isn't a prediction but a possibility if artificial intelligence works for customers and Nvidia's lead is intact.\" He went on to note that the probability of the company reaching that lofty height was (in his view) a fairly slim 10% to 15%.",
      "Yet Anderson remains focused on the big picture. \"It is the long duration of the development of [GPU] usage in AI -- and not just AI -- from excitement, through potential pauses, to transformation of industries that is most important to us,\" Anderson noted.",
      "There's the matter of Nvidia's valuation, which is frankly complicated. It's currently trading for 51 times earnings. That seems expensive at first glance, but trailing valuations rarely keep up with high-growth stocks. For example, Nvidia's average P/E multiple over the past decade is 59, which suggests the stock is historically cheap now. Furthermore, Nvidia is also trading at roughly 29 times next year's expected earnings, which is an attractive price relative to the opportunity.",
      "Asking whether Nvidia could hit $50 trillion might be the wrong question. Rather, investors should be asking themselves whether they should invest in an industry leader with a long track record of innovation, that is being driven by once-in-a-generation secular tailwinds, especially if they can buy the stock at a reasonable price.",
      "Based on those criteria, Nvidia is definitely a buy.",
      "Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:",
      "The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.",

      "Predictions of artificial intelligence reaching human-level intelligence have been made for over 50 years. Regardless, the quest to achieve it continues even today, with almost everyone working in the AI field being too focused on achieving it. According to Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, reaching AGI isn’t a milestone we can define by a particular date.",
      "READ ALSO: Top 12 AI Stock News and Ratings Dominating Wall Street and 10 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm",
      "In the latest innovations in artificial intelligence, new research has revealed how the upcoming AIs are capable of human deceit. Joint experiments conducted by AI Company Anthropic and the nonprofit Redwood Research reveal how Anthropic’s model, Claude is capable of strategically misleading its creators during the training process in order to avoid being modified. According to Evan Hubinger, a safety researcher at Anthropic, this will make it harder for scientists to align “AI systems” to human values.",
      "Researchers have also found evidence that as AIs become more powerful, their capability to deceive their human creators also increases. Consequently, it means scientists would be less confident about the effectiveness of their alignment techniques as AI becomes more advanced.",
      "A similar research conducted by AI safety organization Apollo Research revealed how OpenAI’s latest model, o1, also intentionally deceived its testers during an experiment. The test required the model to achieve its goal at all costs, where it lied when it believed that telling the truth would ultimately lead to its deactivation.",
      "For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.",
      "Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

The partnership has helped to enhance the in-car entertainment experience for Tesla drivers by offering LiveOne’s streaming services.",
      "Overall, TSLA ranks 3rd on our list of buzzing AI stocks on latest news and ratings.

      "Wood's followers affectionately dubbed her “Mama Cathie” after she drew widespread attention with a remarkable 153% return in 2020.",
      "However, her longer-term performance isn’t so rosy:",
      "The flagship ARK Innovation ETF  (ARKK) , with $6.7 billion under management, has returned 11.08% year-to-date through Dec. 19, with an annualized three-year return of -15.50% and a five-year return of just 3.38%.",
      "In comparison, the S&P 500 is up 24.66% this year, with a three-year annualized return of 9.98% and a five-year return of 14.65%.",
      "Cathie Wood’s investment strategy is straightforward: Her ARK ETFs typically buy shares in emerging, high-tech companies in fields such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, DNA sequencing, energy storage, and robotics.",
      "Wood believes these companies will transform industries, but their volatility causes significant swings in ARK funds' values.",
      "Related: Cathie Wood's net worth: The Ark Invest CEO's wealth & income",

      "From Dec. 17 to Dec. 19, Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF  (ARKK)  sold 34,598 shares of Tesla and 33,402 shares of Palantir Technologies  (PLTR) , and her Fintech innovation ETF  (ARKF)  sold 19,426 shares of Coinbase Global  (COIN) .",
